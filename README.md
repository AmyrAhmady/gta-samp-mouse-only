# Play GTA SAMP with your mouse and no keyboard!
***For some reason some people think it's a troll or an inside joke, IT IS NOT! This is a legit mod for those who want to play with one hand or they are forced to.***

A mod for GTA SAMP to play with mouse only, allowing to perform basic main actions such as jumping, crouching, walking around, driving and et cetera.  This mod also serves its purpose to makes it accessible for disabled players to play the game.

(Yes, I know there is some repetitive code or basically everything thrown into one file to handle all actions, I'll get it sorted when I add support for other SAMP clients in the near future.)

## Notes

- This mod only works with ***SA:MP 0.3.7 R1*** (not even GTA SA singleplayer).
- In order to use an on-screen keyboard, you need to run GTASA in windowed mode, there are multiple ASI plugins for that which can assist you with that and one can be found here:
https://ugbase.eu/threads/gta-sa-multiprocess-updated.4100/
- You need to enable Steer with Mouse in **Options** -> **Controller Setup** -> **Mouse Settings** to perform wheel steering while driving.
- You will also need to bind the jump action to **SPACE** key instead of **Left Shift** in order to lett this mod simulate the key press for you.
- You also need to disable cursor mode first to go to game's pause menu

## Installation

1. You need [SAMP 0.3.7 R1](https://github.com/KrustyKoyle/files.sa-mp.com-Archive/blob/master/sa-mp-0.3.7-install.exe) installed.
2. To use this mod you need an ASI loader, I recommend [Silent's ASI Loader](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=21709) since I've been using it without any issue for over past 10 years, all what you have to do is copy its contents to your GTA SA's installation directory.
3. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/AmyrAhmady/gta-samp-mouse-only) tab and download latest version of the ASI plugin and copy the `.asi` file into your GTA SA installation directory.

## Usage

- **Double Middle button click**: To enable cursor; If you are running GTA SA in windowed mode with an on screen keyboard, you can do this to use your virtual keyboard, useful for sending messages or performing commands (like you can click on T key on your OSK to open chat text box to write on it using your OSK) or, for other purposes if needed.
- **Middle button click**: Move forward, both **on foot** and **in vehicle** (simulates holding `W` key).
- **Forward button click**: Crouch, pressing it again after crouching would make your character stand up.
- **Back button click[ON FOOT]**: Jump (Please read the Notes section about this!).
- **Back button click[IN VEHICLE]**: Simulates pressing and holding `S` key, to perform a slow brake or driving reverse (You can even do a burst out (is that the word?) by enabling this and move forward).
- **Double Right click**: To enter and exit vehicles.
- **Triple Right click**: To enter a vehicle as a passenger (if there are empty/ available passenger seats).
